        <h1>Happy Halloween!</h1>
        
        <p>My dad started carving pumpkins when I was little as a way to entertain my brother and me - but why carve triangle faces
        when there are so many other possibilities? We started out using free patterns printed off the internet specifically for
        pumpkin carvings, but there aren't a lot of good anime-themed patterns, so I started working off of screencaps and fanart
        instead. Calvin and Hobbes have been some of my dad's favorites, and he even used a Dremel for one year's Doctor Strange.
        None of it is original art, but it's still tons of fun!</p>
        
        <p>It has been a lot harder to find the time and means since entering college, unfortunately; I didn't get around to it at all
        in freshman year, and my latest pumpkin was carved just before winter finals rather than at Halloween. Still, I hope that I can
        keep it going in future years in some capacity or another.</p>
