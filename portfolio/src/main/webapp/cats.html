        <p>Meet Ender (the striped and white one) and Valentine (the floofy grey one). Yes, Ender and Valentine 
        as in Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card - my dad named them. (My family also previously had two cats named 
        Calvin and Hobbes.) Ender actually passed away last year, but he was a very playful and affectionate cat; 
        he'd often climb into my lap or behind my back when I sat on the sofa and rub his face against mine. 
        Valentine's a bit more reserved, but she still loves to be brushed and isn't shy about asking for it! My 
        family is full of cat people; I'm fairly certain that the humans meow more than the cats!</p>
